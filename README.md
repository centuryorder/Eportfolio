### 1. [Recipe App Planning Documentation.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x-oBQozXc0KV2VCZILPoJpBXemT-pWt7Lr9LIIoeOBU/edit)
   * This document describes how my group plan on creating an Android recipe app. This document shows the basic requirement requested by a client and how our group approaches each requirement.
   * I learn how to prepare before creating a sotware. And making a clients requirement into something that could be translated into a code.

   * This document describes how my group plan on testing an Android recipe app. The document also stated how an independent testing team should test our app and how they should submit a bug report.
   * I learn how to collaborate with another team and testing an application.
    
### 3. [Completed Recipe App: Recipe Galore.](https://gitlab.com/Centuryorder/RecipeAndroidApp.git)
  * Completed Android recipe app. It is an app that allows the user to search and favorite their recipe. The app also allows the user to generate a shopping list on any of the recipe they search.

  * Text-based game A text-based game based on the popular text-based game "Zork" in the late 70s.
  * This project taught me the basic ways of saving data into a custom file. And how to use that file to restore the state of the application.
  

### 5. [Website with local shop search feature: Super search.](https://gitlab.com/Centuryorder/supersearch.git)
  * It is a website that allows the user to search for a local shop near their saved location. A website that is created using React as the GUI front and Postgres SQL for the database backend.
  * This project allows me to learn a new language called React and how to connect a database with a website.
